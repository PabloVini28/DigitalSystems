## FPGA was not used in the practice ❎

## Remarks 📝

- The project consists of implementing the Moore Finite State Machine.
  
- The TestBench is adapted for simulation within the environment itself.
  
- The stimuli present in the TestBench can be modified without issues.
  
- Place the TestBench in the sim_ folder and the fsm_moore in the designs folder.
  
- Click on run simulation and visualize the graph.
