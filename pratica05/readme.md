# Practice 05 - FSM Mealy Y2Y1 🖥️

## FPGA was not used in the practice ❎

## Remarks 📝

- The project consists of implementing the Mealy Finite State Machine Y2Y1.
  
- Resolution of question 3 from the PDF.
  
- The TestBench is adapted for simulation within the environment itself.
  
- The stimuli present in the TestBench can be modified without issues.
  
- Place the TestBench in the sim_ folder and the fsm_mealy_y2y1 in the designs folder.
  
- Click on run simulation and visualize the graph.
